### UML 
Here is a section to know all about Unified Modeling Language (UML).

Some useful links:
- [uml-diagrams.org](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/)

The **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** is a standard visual modeling language intended to be used for

- modeling business and similar processes,
- analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems

UML is a common language for **business analysts**, **software architects** and **developers** used to describe, specify, design, and document existing or new business processes, structure and behavior of artifacts of software systems.

**Note that:** UML is a standard modeling language, not a software development process.

UML is intentionally **process independent** and could be applied in the context of different processes. Still, it is most suitable for **use case driven**, **iterative** and **incremental** development processes. An example of such process is **Rational Unified Process (RUP)**.
