## Design Patterns 
Here is a section to know all about Design Patterns.

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

### Design Patterns vs Algorithms
**Patterns** are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an **algorithm** always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

### Design Pattern vs Design Principles
**Design principles** provide high level guidelines to design better software applications. They do not provide implementation guidelines and are not bound to any programming language. The SOLID (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) principles are one of the most popular sets of design principles.

**Design Pattern** provides low-level solutions related to implementation, of commonly occurring object-oriented problems. In other words, design pattern suggests a specific implementation for the specific object-oriented programming problem. For example, if you want to create a class that can only have one object at a time, then you can use the Singleton design pattern which suggests the best way to create a class that can only have one object.

### What does the pattern consist of?
- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

### Why should I learn patterns?
- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion. No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name.

## Classification of patterns
- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    - **Memento** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
